measure relatedness of posts
	do not use edit distance of words
		ana eat apples
		apples are good to eat
		distance = 2 + 3 deletes
		but still the problem of reordering
		
	do use bag of words
		count occurences of word
		create a huge vector (vectorization) with important (salient) featues
		has dimension equal to as many words in the whole dataset
		(slow) do an Euclidean distance between 2 vectors
		(fast)
			exact salient features
			compute cluster
			
			determine cluster for new post
			from cluster fetch a handful of posts
		
cluster them
see what cluster a new post belongs to
show relevant questions and answers
